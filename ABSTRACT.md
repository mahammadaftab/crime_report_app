# Abstract

The Accident and Crime Report App is a modern, secure, and anonymous incident reporting platform designed to empower citizens to contribute to community safety while protecting their privacy. Built with cutting-edge web technologies, this application provides a seamless interface for users to report accidents and criminal activities without revealing their identity.

The system leverages Next.js 14+ with TypeScript for a robust frontend experience, combined with PostgreSQL database management through Prisma ORM for reliable data storage. Key features include anonymous reporting capabilities that ensure user privacy, email verification with OTP for account security, and role-based access control separating regular users from administrative personnel.

One of the standout features of this application is its AI-powered analysis using Google's Gemini AI, which can process incident images to extract contextual information and categorize reports automatically. The integration with Mapbox provides precise location tracking, allowing authorities to respond quickly and effectively to reported incidents.

Additional functionalities include a reward system that incentivizes active community participation, real-time report tracking with unique identification codes, and emergency auto-call features for critical situations. The application also incorporates performance optimizations such as code splitting, dynamic imports, and API caching to ensure a smooth user experience comparable to typical React.js applications.

This project demonstrates how modern web technologies can be utilized to create socially responsible applications that bridge the gap between citizens and law enforcement agencies while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security.

# Emergency Detection System

## Overview
The emergency detection system automatically detects critical situations using device sensors and immediately contacts the appropriate emergency services.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Emergency Contact Dropdown
- Added "Fire Station: 101" to the emergency contacts list
- Available in both desktop and mobile navigation
- One-tap calling for all emergency services

### 2. Automatic Emergency Detection
The system can detect:
- **Car accidents** - Calls police (100)
- **Fire incidents** - Calls fire department (101)
- **Medical emergencies** - Calls ambulance (101)

### 3. Emergency Services Contact Numbers
- Police: 100
- Ambulance: 101
- Fire Department: 101
- Emergency Police: 108
- Cyber Crime: 1930
- Women Helpline: 100
- Child Helpline: 1930

## Technical Implementation

### Components
1. **EmergencyDetector.tsx** - Main component that runs the detection system
2. **useEmergencyDetection.ts** - Custom hook for sensor-based detection
3. **Navbar.tsx & MobileMenu.tsx** - Updated with Fire Station contact

### How It Works
1. The system continuously monitors device sensors (in a real implementation)
2. When an emergency is detected, it:
   - Shows a notification to the user
   - Requests confirmation before calling
   - Automatically dials the appropriate emergency number

## Important Notes

### Current Implementation Limitations
The current implementation uses simulated detection for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would need to:

1. Integrate with actual device sensors:
   - Accelerometer/Gyroscope for crash detection
   - Temperature sensors for fire detection
   - Health APIs for medical emergencies
   - GPS for location context

2. Implement proper permissions handling:
   - Request sensor access permissions
   - Handle denied permissions gracefully

3. Add background processing capabilities for continuous monitoring

4. Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Privacy Considerations
- All sensor data should be processed locally on the device
- No personal data should be transmitted without explicit consent
- Users should have full control over the detection system

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. The emergency detection system runs automatically in the background
2. When an emergency is detected, you'll receive a notification
3. Confirm the emergency call when prompted
4. Access emergency contacts anytime through the "Emergency" dropdown in the navigation

### For Developers
To enhance the detection capabilities:
1. Add actual sensor integration in `useEmergencyDetection.ts`
2. Implement proper permission handling
3. Add more sophisticated detection algorithms
4. Test thoroughly on various devices

## Future Enhancements
1. Integration with real device sensors
2. Machine learning models for more accurate detection
3. Custom emergency contacts
4. Location-based emergency services
5. Multi-language support for emergency notifications

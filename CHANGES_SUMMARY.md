# Changes Summary: Added Email Verification and Role-Based Access Control

## Overview
Implemented email verification with OTP (One-Time Password) and role-based access control for the authentication system.

## Files Modified

### 1. Prisma Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Added `emailVerified` (Boolean, default: false) field to the User model
- Added `verificationOTP` (String, optional) field to the User model
- Added `otpExpiresAt` (DateTime, optional) field to the User model
- Added `createdAt` (DateTime, default: now()) field to the User model
- Added `updatedAt` (DateTime, updatedAt) field to the User model

### 2. Database Migration (`prisma/migrations/20251021070018_add_email_verification_fields/migration.sql`)
- Created SQL migration to add the new columns to the existing User table

### 3. Authentication API Routes
- `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`:
  - Generate 6-digit OTP during user registration
  - Store OTP with expiration time (10 minutes) in database
  - Send OTP to user's email (currently logs to console)
  - Redirect user to verification page after registration

- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`:
  - Updated authentication to check email verification status
  - Prevent sign in for unverified users

- `app/api/auth/verify/route.ts` (New):
  - Verify OTP codes entered by users
  - Mark email as verified upon successful OTP validation
  - Clear OTP fields after successful verification

- `app/api/auth/resend-otp/route.ts` (New):
  - Generate new OTP codes for users who need them resent
  - Update database with new OTP and expiration time

- `app/api/auth/user-role/route.ts` (New):
  - Get user role for proper dashboard redirection

### 4. Frontend Pages
- `app/auth/signup/page.tsx`:
  - Redirect to verification page after successful registration

- `app/auth/signin/page.tsx`:
  - Show specific error message for unverified emails
  - Redirect users to verification page when needed
  - Redirect users to appropriate dashboard based on role

- `app/auth/verify/page.tsx` (New):
  - UI for users to enter OTP codes
  - Resend OTP functionality
  - Success messaging and automatic redirect

- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`:
  - Added authentication checks
  - Improved loading states

- `app/user-dashboard/page.tsx` (New):
  - Dashboard for regular users
  - Links to submit and track reports

### 5. Utility Files
- `lib/email.ts` (New):
  - Mock email service for sending OTP codes
  - Can be integrated with real email services

- `lib/auth.ts` (New):
  - Helper functions for authentication checks

### 6. Middleware
- `middleware.ts` (New):
  - Protect dashboard routes
  - Implement role-based access control
  - Redirect users based on authentication status and role

### 7. Documentation
- `README.md`:
  - Updated features list to include email verification
- `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_FEATURES.md` (New):
  - Detailed documentation of the email verification implementation

## Implementation Details

### Email Verification Flow
1. User registers with email, name, and password
2. System generates 6-digit OTP and stores it with 10-minute expiration
3. System sends OTP to user's email (currently logs to console)
4. User is redirected to verification page
5. User enters OTP on verification page
6. System validates OTP and marks email as verified
7. User can now sign in to the application

### Role-Based Access Control
1. Users are assigned roles (ADMIN or USER) during registration
2. Only ADMIN users can access the admin dashboard
3. Regular users are redirected to a user dashboard
4. Middleware protects routes based on authentication status and role

### Security Considerations
1. OTP codes expire after 10 minutes
2. Email verification is required before sign in
3. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
4. Role-based access control prevents unauthorized access

## Testing the Features

1. Register a new user account
2. Check console for OTP code
3. Navigate to verification page
4. Enter OTP code to verify email
5. Sign in to test role-based redirection
